# Guilt-free-gourmet

Database is going to be returned by either external and locally ways:
1. API external request to Edamam 
2. Once the user saves the recipe from that external API => It will be stored locally and able to modify it in order to create his own recipe.

## TO DO
1. Test that all data is being properly seeded in sequelize. => Check on associations for category and recipe tables.
2. Test that routes are working properly.
3. POST and DELETE methods are working right? => Add comments and recipes.
4. Start working on the external API request. => Edamam.
5. See a future implementation => Upload a picture from the user?
Or another website functionality.
6. ASK about Array dataType on the list of nutrients.
